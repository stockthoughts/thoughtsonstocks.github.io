     <h4>About the Project</h4>
     <p>This website is a personal project where I share my stock watchlists,
         market insights, and commentary on financial news and trends. 
         It serves as a public journal of my thoughts on market dynamics, 
         company fundamentals, macroeconomic events, and other topics that catch my interest.
          My goal is to provide a clear, transparent look at how I think about the markets 
        and to encourage thoughtful discussionâ€”whether you're a seasoned investor or just starting out.
    </p>
